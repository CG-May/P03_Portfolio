			  <h1>Hello!<br>My Name is Cassandra Graves!</h1>
			  <div class="bioContent">
					  <p>I am a passionate digital design student, artist, sketcher and photographer. I love experimenting and growing my skills in various different mediums, from programming to graphic layouts to video editing to web design! My professional and personal passions overlap quite a bit: I enjoy hiking in the outdoors taking photographs and listening to the sounds of nature, sketching a variety of different subjects from cartoons to more intricate patterns, and writing stories and ideating different stories and characters. I am hardworking, energetic, and colourful, and always wish to represent my personality in the work I do.</p>
					  <p>Overall, I am open to a wide variety of different professions as my skillset is very adaptable and easily molded to any task I need to undergo. I can easily hold up the backbone of a project or be the front runner of the projects leadership role. I am most drawn to a career in photography. I believe with my technical knowledge of the inner workings of cameras, editing photos and setting up equipment needed for a shoot, combined with my design knowledge of colour, layouts and harmony would lend very well in this type of career. I really wish to put myself out there and be a worker than any person, group, or company can rely on.</p>
