  <h2>Process Analysis</h2>
  <p>Out of all the courses I've taken, it surprised me how much I enjoyed photography. Even after finishing my projects for the course Digital Photography, I still find myself passionately taking pictures of everything I can. Even if my image quality isn't the greatest, as my main camera is an iPhone 7, I enjoy seeing what I can create and document. </p>

	<p>The final project for this course was for ourselves to select 20 of our best images we took during the semester, and present them in a final portfolio. However, not only did these images have to be first accepted by our own peers, but by our professor as well. With over 100+ images taken this would seem easy, but as Malcolm Gladwell said, in order to stand out among others is "ten thousand hours of practice is required" (Outliers: The Story of Success, pg 40). For myself not even hitting 50 hours of practice shooting and editing, my work was quite mediocre. </p>

	<p>In order to elevate my work up to the level that was needed, I reviewed the images I had currently produced and asked for feedback from my peers about what was working and what needed to be revised. I also reviewed the various photography concepts we were taught as well as images that embodied those concepts perfectly, and why those images were more effective than mine. Doing this review process made my final images more refined and polished than they were earlier on in the course.</p>

	<p>Another challenge was making sure my portfolio had a large variety. While not specified for this project, as an artist I take pride in having a wide variety of polished skills over having one polished skill. While I have many images of textures, close-up shots, birds and landscapes, I knew I had to branch out and experiment more. This lead to some of my more interesting images involving more heavy manipulation, different types of lenses and even more odd methods of picture taking such as taking images with scanners, and many more techniques that were a bit more unconventional. This strategy was a success as while not all my images were perfect, all of them were unique and I feel showcased my personality as a photographer quite well.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
	<p>When I was younger, I had dreams of becoming some kind of artist. Bouncing back between different art mediums such as illustration and animation, I honestly wasn't sure what I really wanted to do. While my current degree is Interactive Arts & Technology, nothing here really clicked until I started this photography course. It was one of the most enlightening experiences I've had at university of just how much I love to do something where it didn't feel like homework or a chore, it feel like an experience. While the final portfolio I had to display was a success, I also look back on this project and the progress I made during it as a great progression of my skills and passions as well. In the end, I wish to produce more projects like this in the future, whether it's professionally or personally.</p>
